This is an implementation of the paper 

Chih-Kuan Yeh*, Wei-Chieh Wu*, Wei-Jen Ko, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang 'Learning Deep Latent Spaces for Multi-Label Classfications' published in AAAI 2017 (* indicated equal contribution)

We thank Weiran Wang, Raman Arora, Karen Livescu and Jeff Bilmes for the layout of the matlab code in http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~wwang5/dccae.html

Chih-Kuan Yeh thanks his co-author of the papers, Wei-Chieh Wu who contributed significantly to modifying the layout of the program. 

The code is further polished by Chih-Kuan Yeh.

If you have any questions regarding the code please contact Chih-Kuan Yeh at jason6582@gmail.com

The demo code is ran on parsed dataset of mirflickr, which can easily be applied on other multi-label datasets by including the .mat file and modifying demo.m

Simply run demo.m to see the results on  mirflickr.
